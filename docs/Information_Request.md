# Dragon Voice Project - Information Request

To effectively implement the Dragon Voice Project according to your specific needs, we need some additional information. Your responses will help us tailor the system to your environment and requirements.

## Dragon Medical One Integration Information

1. **Dragon Medical One Configuration:**
   - Which version of Dragon Medical One are you using?
   - Does your Dragon Medical One installation have any custom commands or macros?
   - Do you have administrator access to configure Dragon Medical One?

2. **Output Methods:**
   - Does Dragon Medical One allow outputting dictated text to a file? If yes, can you specify the location?
   - Does Dragon Medical One copy dictated text to the clipboard?
   - Are there any Dragon Medical One APIs available for direct integration?
   - Do you have existing Dragon Medical One commands that could be repurposed for this project?

3. **Voice Command Preferences:**
   - What specific voice command would you like to use to trigger query distribution?
   - Do you need additional voice commands for system control (e.g., pause/resume, clear)?
   - Should the system provide audio confirmation when a query is processed?

## Network Environment Information

1. **Network Configuration:**
   - Are all client computers on the same local network?
   - Are there any firewalls that might block communication on port 5000?
   - Do you need to connect clients across different networks or subnets?
   - Are there any network security policies that might affect this project?

2. **Client Computer Details:**
   - How many client computers will typically be involved?
   - What operating systems are installed on the client computers?
   - Do all client computers have direct network access to the server computer?
   - Is there a need for remote access to the system (outside the local network)?

## Browser and Search Requirements

1. **Browser Preferences:**
   - Are all client computers using Chrome, or do you need support for other browsers?
   - Do you use any browser extensions that might affect automation?
   - Are there any specific websites or applications where the queries will be used?

2. **Search Behavior Requirements:**
   - Do any search interfaces require special handling (e.g., waiting for page load)?
   - Are there specific keyboard shortcuts or sequence of actions needed for some websites?
   - Do you need to handle authentication for any of the search interfaces?

   - Would you like email notifications for critical errors?
   - Do you need regular usage reports or statistics?

## Future Expansion

1. **Planned Enhancements:**
   - Are there additional features you would like to see in future versions?
   - Do you anticipate scaling the system to more client computers?
