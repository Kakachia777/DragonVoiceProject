## Timeline Estimates

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | 2-3 weeks | Python environment setup |
| Phase 2 | 3-4 weeks | Completion of Phase 1 |
| Phase 3 | 2-3 weeks | Dragon Medical One access, Completion of Phase 2 |
| Phase 4 | 3-4 weeks | Completion of Phase 3 |

## Resource Requirements

### Development Resources
- Python 3.x development environment
- Access to multiple test computers
- Network with client-server test capability
- Dragon Medical One software (for Phase 3)

### Testing Resources

- Various search interfaces for testing
- Network with different configurations
- Multiple client computers

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Network restrictions blocking communication | High | Medium | Test early with actual network infrastructure, develop fallback communication methods |
| Browser updates breaking automation | Medium | High | Use robust window detection, implement version checking, regular testing |
| Dragon Medical One limitations | High | Medium | Research thoroughly before implementation, develop alternative input methods |
| Performance issues with multiple clients | Medium | Medium | Stress test early, optimize communication protocol |
| Security concerns | High | Low | Implement basic authentication, limit to secure networks |

## Success Criteria
- Successfully dictate query in Dragon Medical One
- Query appears in all client browsers within 2 seconds
- Search is executed on all clients simultaneously
- System handles errors gracefully
- Documentation is comprehensive and user-friendly
